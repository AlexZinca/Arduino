In the project, a BME280 sensor was simulated by using a digital temperature sensor. Data regarding the greenhouse environment were transmitted using the SPI protocol enabling serial communication between two microcontrollers.
The information was presented in real time on an LCD, allowing users to define temperature thresholds via two interrupt-driven buttons. The project was done exclusively through direct manipulation of data registers.
